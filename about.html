			<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
	    	<h3>Do you take commissions?</h3>
	    	<p>Unfortunately, I don't really do at the moment, as I have no viable payment method set up for that yet. Maybe someday in the future I'll set up a Ko-fi page for that.</p>
			<h3>What programming language(s) do you want to learn?</h3>
			<p>I plan to start learning C, and maybe later on I could try others like C#, PHP and JavaScript. Right now I was learning Python, but I'm still having some troubles with that one.</p><br>
			I have yet to put more stuff here, but for now; you can find my socials <i>(which can include other information about me)</i> on the <a href="socials.html" style="color:#000;text-decoration:underline;">Socials</a> page!</div>

        <h2 id="bio">About me!</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Sylvia</strong>, and I'm a <strong>19-year-old</strong> girl from <strong>Hungary</strong>! I also sometimes draw digital art and make GFX!<br>
            My favorite games are usually rhythm games, mainly StepMania. I also like Tetris, Puyo Puyo, Geometry Dash, as well as Touhou Project. I also sometimes play a variety of other games too!<br>
            I have a huge interest in tech in nearly all aspects; mostly on the software side, and a little bit on the hardware side. I'm also learning programming at the moment.</p>

            <h2 id="faq">"FAQ"</h2>
            <h3>Do you take commissions?</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately, I don't really do at the moment, as I have no proper viable payment method set up for that yet.<br>
                While I do have a Ko-Fi page for that, and a PayPal account to accept income, they're not yet ready to be used for them.<br>
                Add on to the fact that I'm basically demotivated with drawing right now, and yeah...
            </p>
            <h3>What programming language(s) do you want to learn?</h3>
            <p>I plan to start learning C/C++ <i>(or maybe Rust??)</i> in the future, and/or I could try others web stuff like PHP and JavaScript. Right now I'm learning C#.<br>
                For now, I just tend to screw around with HTML and CSS from time to time.</p><br>
                I have yet to put more stuff here, but for now; you can find my socials <i>(which can include other information about me)</i> on the <a href="socials.html"><u>Socials</u></a> page!</div>

        <p>Hello! My name is Sylvia, and I'm an 18 year old hungarian girl with a huge interest in tech. I also sometimes draw digital art and make GFX!<br>
        My favorite games are usually rhythm games, mainly StepMania. I also like Tetris, Puyo Puyo, as well as Touhou Project. I also sometimes play a variety of other games too!<br>
        I have a huge interest in tech in nearly all aspects; mostly on the software side, and a little bit on the hardware side. I'm also learning programming at the moment.</p>

        <h2 id="faq">"FAQ"</h2>
        <h3>Do you take commissions?</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, I don't really do at the moment, as I have no proper viable payment method set up for that yet. While I do have a Ko-Fi page for that, and a PayPal account to accept income, they're not yet ready to be used for commissions.</p>
        <h3>What programming language(s) do you want to learn?</h3>
        <p>I plan to start learning C, and maybe later on I could try others like C#, PHP and JavaScript. Right now I was learning Python, but I'm still having some troubles with that one.<br>
        For now, I just tend to screw around with HTML and CSS from time to time.</p><br>
        I have yet to put more stuff here, but for now; you can find my socials <i>(which can include other information about me)</i> on the <a href="socials.html"><u>Socials</u></a> page!</div>

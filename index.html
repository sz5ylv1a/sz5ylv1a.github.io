        <h2>Hello there!</h2>
        Welcome to my website! Expect <i>some</i> changes over time and stuff probably not working as intended as this is under construction; basically a work-in-progress in its current state.<br><br>
        While you're here, have this flash animation my friend <a href="http://joncoale.tk" target="_blank" title="Click here to visit his website!"><u>joncoale</u></a> made<br>
        <video src="resources/videos/sylva.mp4" controls></video><br><br>
        ...and this random thing I screamed into my mic a year or two ago <font color=red><i>(VOLUME WARNING)</i></font><br>
        <audio src="resources/audio/SPIDER COCK.mp3" type="audio/mp3" controls></audio><br><br>
        <h4 style="margin-bottom:10px;">Random other things I've made for this site:</h4>
        <a href="hell.html" style="font-weight:600;color:#400">h e l l</a> <i>[created on 10/09/2022, uploaded on 11/12/2022]</i><br>
        <a href="freeli.html" style="font-weight:600;color:#069">free lorem ipsum</a> <i>[created and uploaded on 02/11/2023]</i><br>

        Dark mode is planned, but not implemented yet, so for now use an extension like <a href="https://darkreader.org/" target="_blank" title="Click here to install it!"><u>Dark Reader</u></a> <i>(not sponsored)</i><br>
        And yes, I did make this site all on my own.

		<h2>Site Changelog <i>(release dates are in mm/dd/yyyy)</i></h2>
		<li id="0.1.2">v0.1.2 - 08/02/2025</li>
		<br>oh hey an update!! hasn't happened in a while, huh?
		<ul>
			<li>Discord server has now been replaced with an URI to my profile, as I do not maintain my server anymore and have sunsetted it for good since. A little notice for this has been added in case for those clicking on the button for the first time</li>
			<li>link to Twitter has now been removed for good, as foreshadowed from the last update</li>
			<li>fixed a bunch of CSS properties missing unit measurements, so everything should look right</li>
			<li>updated embed code for the Google Fonts import of the font used for this website, which is Asap; alongside changing the emoji set to Noto Color Emoji instead of leeching off of Firefox's Twemoji set (which is already outdated)</li>
			<li>after careful consideration, I will not add Patreon to my profile, but Ko-fi should do the job anyways <i>(if I ever end up utilizing it)</i></li>
			<li>site description(s) rewritten entirely to look more "professional" and "SEO-friendly"</li>
			<li>add an instant redirect to the <a href="about.html">About</a> page when trying to go to the separate <i>(and now technically deprecated)</i> FAQ page</li>
			<li>removed link to SpaceHey due to excessive inactivity</li>
			<li>replace Newgrounds and Ko-fi icons with custom-made edited ones instead of placeholders from Font Awesome</li>
			<li>big code cleanup and linting of CSS and JS files</li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<li id="0.1.1">v0.1.1 - 10/27/2024</li>
		<br>a little polishing...
		<ul>
			<li>increased width of the mobile view so that more content can fit</li>
			<li>twitter link is now no longer available since i left the platform for good; button link will be removed in a later update</li>
			<li>contrary to the last one, positions for Twitter and Bluesky have been swapped to better prioritize the other two social media platforms</li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<li id="0.1.0">v0.1.0 - 09/22/2024</li>
		<br>aaaand we're out of "the alpha stage"! here's what I got to offer:
		<ul>
			<li>completely revamped the navigation bar</li>
			<ul>
				<li>it will now be using the <code>&#60;nav&#62;</code> tag instead of this whole mess of <code>&#60;div&#62;</code> tags</li>
				<li>dropdown menu has been redone from scratch, so now navigating on mobile and lower res screens shouldn't be painfully garbage</li>
				<li>height has been shrinked by a couple pixels</li>
				<li>slight green tint has been added when hovering over menu items</li>
			</ul>
			<li>internal site layout has been reconstructed too so it should look more correct when looking inside</li>
			<li>changed and added some links to various pages and global elements, including the footer</li>
			<li>slightly tweaked css animations on social link buttons in <a href="socials.html">Socials</a> tab</li>
			<li>slightly updated multiple pages</li>
			<li>error pages have been moved to a separate folder</li>
			<li>...and a lot more changes!</li>

		<br>welp, now that my finals are done, time to get back to the fun!!
		<ul>
			<li>FAQ page is now moved to the About Me as a subsection, as well as other additions and changes to that page. Dedicated FAQ page will be replaced with something else later.</li>
			<li>Odysee's icon has been changed to the real one instead of keeping Font Awesome's astronaut icon as a replacement</li>
			<li>"Steam Profile" simplified to "Steam"</li>
			<li>internal code tweaks like beautifying, adding site embed stuff globally and removing stuff that does nothing</li>
			<li>back button for nikola textla was added for slightly easier navigation</li>
